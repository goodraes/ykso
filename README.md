　　我们因为彼此相爱才愿意相守，相爱又相守，家才会变成一个温暖的窝。但是，相爱的两个人组成了家庭之后，并不意味着从此万事大吉，因为现实生活并不是童话故事，不能用一句“从此他们过着幸福的生活”来结尾。家就像一株美丽的植物，只有时时殷勤地呵护，它才能不枯萎，才会在你不经意的时候，为你开出最美丽的花。家又像是一个火炉，只有两个人不断地给它投入爱的木柴，它才不会熄灭，才会不停地散发出温暖。
　　兜里有了一点小钱，吃饭就要讲品位；脑子里有了一点小资，吃饭就要有玫瑰。白领男女相对，专挑小资聚居地，不可喧闹，不可低级，不可猜拳拚酒，不可大鱼大肉，无论吃什么，反正要有悠扬的萨克斯，要有红酒，要有侍者在烛光掩映中低低的问：“先生吃点什么？”

However, after the family love each other, doesn't mean that everything from now on, because real life is not a fairy tale, can't use a "from then on, they lived a happy life" to the end.

Home again like a stove, only two people constantly to it in the wood, the love it does not go out, will send out a warm non-stop.
Pocket with a little money, have a meal to speak grade;
Mind has been a small property, have a meal will have roses.
White-collar men and women, picking the small property settlement, and not noisy, not vulgar, not mora best wine, not the big fish big meat, no matter what to eat, anyway be melodious saxophone, want to have red wine, want to have a waiter in a shaded by candlelight asked in a low voice: "eat a point what, Sir?"
